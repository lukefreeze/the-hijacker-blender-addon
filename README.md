## What Is The Hijacker?

Blender's built-in audio tools are limited to basic volume and pan — there's no per-channel DSP, no real-time processing, and no way to route audio through effects chains. The Hijacker replaces Blender's audio playback entirely with a custom C++ engine that gives you a full mixing desk and AI processing suite directly inside Blender.

The engine (`hijacker_engine.pyd` / `.so`) is a compiled C++ extension handling all audio I/O, mixing, and DSP natively — bypassing Python's GIL and Blender's `aud` limitations entirely. The UI is a GPU-drawn HUD living in Blender's Node Editor, rendered with Blender's `gpu` module — no external GUI frameworks, no ImGui, no native windows.

## Features

### Mixing Desk
- Full 9-channel mixing desk rendered directly in Blender's Node Editor
- Per-channel: volume fader (with dB readout), gain knob, stereo pan, mute, solo
- Real-time VU meters with peak hold
- Scrollable, scalable HUD — fits any screen size and zoom level
- PNG skin system — full visual reskinning via `ui/assets/skins/default/`
- Table background aesthetic — the desk sits on a virtual studio table surface

### DSP Racks (real-time, per-channel)
| Rack | Controls |
|------|----------|
| **Compressor** (single-band) | Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release, Makeup, Knee |
| **Compressor** (multiband) | 4-band with independent controls per band |
| **7-Band Parametric EQ** | Low shelf, 5× parametric, high shelf |
| **Reverb** | Freeverb algorithm — Room, Damping, Width, Wet, Pre-delay |
| **Noise Gate** | Threshold, Attack, Release, Hold, Range |
| **Stereo Delay** | Time, Feedback, Mix, Ping-pong, LP filter |

All DSP racks support presets accessible via ◄ ► arrows in the rack rail.

### DSP Processing Racks (real-time or offline, per-channel)
In addition to the effect racks above:

| Rack | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Booster** | Volume amplification beyond Blender's strip volume cap — with soft limiter |

### AI Racks (offline, background-threaded)
All AI racks run as background subprocesses — Blender stays fully responsive during processing.

| Rack | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Voicefixer** | Voice restoration — repairs degraded, clipped or low-quality recordings |
| **Demucs** | Stem separation — splits a track into vocals, drums, bass, other |
| **KNNVC** | Voice conversion — converts recorded dialogue to a different voice |
| **Piper TTS** | Offline neural text-to-speech — no internet, no API keys |
| **Whisper** | Speech-to-text — transcribes audio and generates VSE subtitle strips |

## Installation

### Requirements
- Blender 4.5
- Windows x64 (macOS and Linux builds included — real-world testing in progress)

### Install the beta (for testers)
1. Download `TheHijacker-beta.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/lukefreeze/the-hijacker-blender-addon/releases) page
2. In Blender: `Edit → Preferences → Add-ons`, then click the **▼ dropdown** in the top-right of the Add-ons panel and choose **Install from Disk...** (or just drag the zip into the panel)
3. Select the zip as downloaded — don't unzip it first
4. Enable the checkbox next to **The Hijacker**
5. Open a Node Editor area and click **The Hijacker** button in the header

### Build from source (for contributors)
Only needed if you're working on the addon itself — testers should use the beta zip above.
1. Clone the repo
2. In Blender: `Edit → Preferences → Add-ons`, dropdown → **Install from Disk...**
3. Point Blender at `blender_sync/Loader.py`
4. Enable **The Hijacker**

## Building the C++ Engine

The engine is pre-built for all platforms via GitHub Actions. If you need to build locally on Windows:

```bat
build.bat
```

Requires MSVC, Python 3.11 headers, pybind11, and PortAudio static lib. See `build.bat` for full dependency list.

Cross-platform builds (Windows / macOS / Linux) run automatically on every push to `feature/hijacker-engine` via `.github/workflows/build.yml`. Download artifacts from the [Actions](https://github.com/lukefreeze/the-hijacker-blender-addon/actions) tab.

## Development Branch

Active development is on `feature/hijacker-engine`. The `main` branch contains early prototypes and is not representative of the current state.

---

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full development plan.

**Remaining before v1.0:**
- [ ] UI polish pass — final PNG skins for all rack panels
- [ ] Universal addon zip packaging with platform auto-detection
- [ ] Mixdown rack — render all channels to a final audio file
- [ ] Undo support and save trigger
- [ ] macOS and Linux real-world testing
